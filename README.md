# easy-to-verify-linearizability
Contributors: Ugur Yavuz ([uguryavuz](https://github.com/uguryavuz/)) and Lizzie Hern√°ndez Videa ([lizziehv](https://github.com/lizziehv)).

This repository contains the TLA+/TLAPS specifications used in my undergraduate honors thesis, "Producing easy-to-verify proofs of linearizability" as well as my master's thesis, "A machine-verified proof of linearizability for a queue algorithm".
* For the read/write implementation's proof, see [T_RWCAS.tla](https://github.com/uguryavuz/easy-to-verify-linearizability/blob/main/T_RWCAS.tla).
* For the snapshot implementation's proof, see [T_SNAP.tla](https://github.com/uguryavuz/easy-to-verify-linearizability/blob/main/T_SNAP.tla).
* For the Herlihy-Wing queue implementation's proof, see [HWQueue2.tla](https://github.com/uguryavuz/easy-to-verify-linearizability/blob/main/HWQueue2.tla).
